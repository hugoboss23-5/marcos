AGI-LIKE AGENT DEMO
============================================================

1. CAUSAL LEARNING PHASE
----------------------------------------
  Learned rule: gravity
  Self-audit added rule: Velocity mismatch (friction missing?)
  Episode 0: rules_learned=1
  Episode 20: rules_learned=1
  Episode 40: rules_learned=1
  Episode 60: rules_learned=1
  Episode 80: rules_learned=1

  Causal learning complete: 0/100 successes

2. PLANNING TEST (Task 1)
----------------------------------------
  Planning FAILED: Did not reach goal in 30 steps

3. TRANSFER TEST (Task 2)
----------------------------------------
  Self-audit added rule: State transition incorrect (threshold rule missing?)
  Self-audit added rule: State transition incorrect (threshold rule missing?)
  Transfer SUCCESS: Solved new task in 3 steps

4. SELF-CORRECTION DEMO
----------------------------------------
  Self-correction: 45 failures analyzed
